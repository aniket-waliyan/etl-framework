# Building a Production-Ready ETL Framework in Go: A Journey from Chaos to Order 🚀

Hey there, fellow code wranglers! 👋 Today, I'm super excited to share my journey of building a scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework in Go. If you've ever dealt with data pipelines, you know they can be as messy as a pizza party in a tornado. But fear not! Let's turn that chaos into order. 🌪️➡️✨

## The Problem: Data Everywhere, But Not Where We Need It 😅

Picture this: You have data scattered across multiple SQL Server shards (because why make life easy, right?), and you need to consolidate it into a PostgreSQL database. Oh, and did I mention it needs to:
- Run on a schedule ⏰
- Handle failures gracefully 🤕
- Scale horizontally 📈
- Not wake you up at 3 AM with cryptic errors 😴

Sound familiar? That's exactly what led to this project.

## Project Structure: The Blueprint 📁

Before we dive into the cool features, let's understand how this bad boy is organized:

```

└── docker-compose-*.yml   # Database setup for development
```

## The Solution: Enter the ETL Framework 🦸‍♂️

Think of it as your personal data superhero, swooping in to save the day with features like:
- Modular pipeline architecture (because nobody likes spaghetti code 🍝)
- Database sharding support (for when your data is playing hide and seek)
- Flexible scheduling (because timing is everything)
- Production-ready monitoring (so you can actually sleep at night)

Let's dive into how it all works! 🏊‍♂️

## Architecture: The Building Blocks 🏗️

### 1. The Pipeline Interface

First, we define our core pipeline components in `pkg/pipeline/pipeline.go`. It's like LEGO, but for data! 🧱

```go
// The holy trinity of ETL
type Extractor interface {
    Extract(ctx context.Context) (<-chan DataRecord, <-chan error)
    Init(cfg *config.Config) error
    Close() error
}

type Transformer interface {
    Transform(ctx context.Context, data interface{}) (interface{}, error)
    Init(cfg *config.Config) error
    Close() error
}

type Loader interface {
    Load(ctx context.Context, data interface{}) error
    Init(cfg *config.Config) error
    Close() error
}

// DataRecord represents a single record in the pipeline
type DataRecord struct {
    Data  interface{}
    Error error
}
```

### 2. Configuration Magic ✨

We use YAML for configuration, making it super easy to customize your pipelines. Here's a real example from `pipelines/login-analytics/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Pipeline Configuration
name: "login-analytics"
description: "Analyzes user login patterns across shards"

# Source Database Configuration
source:
  type: "sqlserver"
  shards:
    - host: "${SQLSERVER_SHARD1_HOST}"
      port: "${SQLSERVER_SHARD1_PORT}"
    - host: "${SQLSERVER_SHARD2_HOST}"
      port: "${SQLSERVER_SHARD2_PORT}"
  credentials:
    username: "${SQLSERVER_USER}"
    password: "${SQLSERVER_PASSWORD}"

# Destination Database
sink:
  type: "postgres"
  host: "${POSTGRES_HOST}"
  port: "${POSTGRES_PORT}"
  database: "${POSTGRES_DB}"
  credentials:
    username: "${POSTGRES_USER}"
    password: "${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}"

# Error Handling (for when things go sideways)
error_handling:
  max_retries: 3
  retry_delay: "5s"
  exponential_backoff: true  # Because persistence is key!
```

### 3. Environment Configuration 🌍

The environment configuration is handled in `pkg/env/env.go`. We use environment variables to keep sensitive information out of the codebase:

```go
type Config struct {
    // Source database configuration
    SQLServerShardHosts []string
    SQLServerShardPorts []int
    SQLServerUser       string
    SQLServerPassword   string

    // Sink database configuration
    PostgresHost     string
    PostgresPort     int
    PostgresDB       string
    PostgresUser     string
    PostgresPassword string
}

func LoadConfig() (*Config, error) {
    // Load configuration from environment variables
    // with smart defaults and validation
}
```

## Pipeline Management: The Control Center 🎮

### 1. The CLI Tool

The `etl-cli` tool is your best friend for creating new pipelines:

```bash
# Generate a new pipeline
./etl-cli generate --name customer-analytics

# This creates a new directory structure:
pipelines/customer-analytics/
├── config.yaml
├── etl.go
└── README.md
```

### 2. Pipeline Lifecycle Management

The `manage-pipeline.sh` script is your Swiss Army knife for pipeline operations:

```bash
# List all pipelines
./scripts/manage-pipeline.sh list

# Start a pipeline
./scripts/manage-pipeline.sh start login-analytics

# Stop a pipeline
./scripts/manage-pipeline.sh stop login-analytics

# Get detailed info about a pipeline
./scripts/manage-pipeline.sh info login-analytics

# Delete a pipeline and its logs
./scripts/manage-pipeline.sh delete login-analytics
```

### 3. Scheduling Like a Boss 😎

Want to run your pipeline on a schedule? We've got you covered with systemd timers:

```bash
# Run daily at midnight
./scripts/manage-pipeline.sh schedule login-analytics daily 00:00

# Run every 2 hours
./scripts/manage-pipeline.sh schedule login-analytics hourly 2

# Run weekly on Mondays at midnight
./scripts/manage-pipeline.sh schedule login-analytics weekly mon 00:00

# Run monthly on the 1st at midnight
./scripts/manage-pipeline.sh schedule login-analytics monthly 1 00:00
```

## Implementation Deep Dive: Login Analytics Pipeline 🔍

Let's look at a real-world example. The login analytics pipeline extracts user login data from SQL Server shards and consolidates it in PostgreSQL.

### 1. The Extractor

```go
type Extractor struct {
    shardConnections []*sql.DB
    config          *config.Config
}

func (e *Extractor) Extract(ctx context.Context) (<-chan pipeline.DataRecord, <-chan error) {
    dataCh := make(chan pipeline.DataRecord)
    errCh := make(chan error)
    
    go func() {
        defer close(dataCh)
        defer close(errCh)
        
        var wg sync.WaitGroup
        // Extract from each shard concurrently
        for _, conn := range e.shardConnections {
            wg.Add(1)
            go func(db *sql.DB) {
                defer wg.Done()
                
                query := `SELECT user_id, login_time, ip_address 
                         FROM user_logins 
                         WHERE login_time > @lastRun`
                         
                rows, err := db.QueryContext(ctx, query)
                if err != nil {
                    errCh <- fmt.Errorf("query failed: %v", err)
                    return
                }
                defer rows.Close()
                
                // Process rows and send to channel
                for rows.Next() {
                    var record LoginRecord
                    if err := rows.Scan(&record.UserID, &record.LoginTime, &record.IPAddress); err != nil {
                        errCh <- fmt.Errorf("scan failed: %v", err)
                        continue
                    }
                    dataCh <- pipeline.DataRecord{Data: record}
                }
            }(conn)
        }
        
        wg.Wait()
    }()
    
    return dataCh, errCh
}
```

### 2. The Transformer

```go
type Transformer struct {
    config *config.Config
}

func (t *Transformer) Transform(ctx context.Context, data interface{}) (interface{}, error) {
    record, ok := data.(LoginRecord)
    if !ok {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid data type")
    }
    
    // Enrich the data with geolocation info
    enriched := EnrichedLoginRecord{
        UserID:    record.UserID,
        LoginTime: record.LoginTime,
        IPAddress: record.IPAddress,
        Location:  getLocationFromIP(record.IPAddress),
        Device:    parseUserAgent(record.UserAgent),
    }
    
    return enriched, nil
}
```

### 3. The Loader

```go
type Loader struct {
    db     *sql.DB
    config *config.Config
}

func (l *Loader) Load(ctx context.Context, data interface{}) error {
    record, ok := data.(EnrichedLoginRecord)
    if !ok {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid data type")
    }
    
    query := `
        INSERT INTO login_analytics 
        (user_id, login_time, ip_address, location, device)
        VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)
    `
    
    _, err := l.db.ExecContext(ctx, query,
        record.UserID,
        record.LoginTime,
        record.IPAddress,
        record.Location,
        record.Device,
    )
    
    return err
}
```

## Error Handling and Retries: Because Stuff Happens 🔄

The framework includes robust error handling with exponential backoff:

```yaml
error_handling:
  max_retries: 3          # Maximum number of retry attempts
  retry_delay: "5s"       # Initial delay between retries
  max_retry_delay: "15m"  # Maximum delay between retries
  exponential_backoff: true
```

In code, it looks like this:

```go
func (p *Pipeline) executeWithRetry(fn func() error) error {
    retryCount := 0
    delay := p.config.ErrorHandling.RetryDelay
    
    for {
        err := fn()
        if err == nil {
            return nil
        }
        
        retryCount++
        if retryCount > p.config.ErrorHandling.MaxRetries {
            return fmt.Errorf("max retries exceeded: %v", err)
        }
        
        if p.config.ErrorHandling.ExponentialBackoff {
            delay = delay * 2
            if delay > p.config.ErrorHandling.MaxRetryDelay {
                delay = p.config.ErrorHandling.MaxRetryDelay
            }
        }
        
        time.Sleep(delay)
    }
}
```

## Monitoring and Logging: Keep Your Eyes on the Prize 👀

### 1. Pipeline Status Monitoring

The `monitor-pipelines.sh` script provides real-time insights:

```bash
./scripts/monitor-pipelines.sh

# Output:
Pipeline: login-analytics
Status: Running
Memory Usage: 124MB
Last Run: 2024-01-20 15:30:00
Next Run: 2024-01-20 16:00:00
Recent Logs:
[INFO] Processed 1000 records
[INFO] Successfully loaded to PostgreSQL
```

### 2. Log Management

Logs are automatically rotated using logrotate:

```conf
/var/log/etl-pipelines/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 7
    compress
    delaycompress
    missingok
    notifempty
    create 0640 etl etl
}
```

## Development Setup: Get Started in Minutes ⚡

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/etl-framework
cd etl-framework
```

2. Set up the development environment:
```bash
./scripts/setup-dev.sh
```

3. Create your environment file:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials
```

4. Initialize the databases:
```bash
./init-databases.sh
```

5. Generate your first pipeline:
```bash
./etl-cli generate --name my-first-pipeline
```

## Troubleshooting Guide: When Things Go Wrong 🔧

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **SQL Server Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check SQL Server container status
docker ps | grep sqlserver

# View SQL Server logs
docker logs sqlserver-shard1
```

2. **PostgreSQL Sink Database Issues**
```bash
# Verify PostgreSQL connection
psql -h localhost -U etl_user -d etl_sink -c "\dt"

# Check PostgreSQL logs
docker logs postgres-sink
```

3. **Pipeline Service Issues**
```bash
# Check service status
systemctl status etl-pipeline-login-analytics

# View service logs
journalctl -u etl-pipeline-login-analytics
```

## Lessons Learned (The Hard Way) 😅

1. **Retries are tricky**: Just like in dating, timing is everything. Too eager? You'll overwhelm the system. Too slow? You'll miss opportunities.

2. **Monitoring is crucial**: It's like having a security camera for your data. Sure, it might be boring to watch, but you'll thank me when something goes wrong!

3. **Configuration over code**: Because the only thing worse than debugging at 3 AM is debugging AND deploying at 3 AM.

4. **Database sharding is complex**: Like herding cats, but the cats are your data and they all want to go in different directions.

5. **Error handling is an art**: Sometimes you need to retry immediately, sometimes you need to back off. It's like knowing when to text back after a first date. 😉

## The Future Roadmap 🗺️

We're not done yet! Here's what's cooking:
- Real-time data streaming support (because batch processing is so yesterday)
- Machine learning pipeline integration (because why not add some AI to the mix?)
- More database connectors (MongoDB, anyone?)
- Distributed tracing integration (OpenTelemetry support)
- Pipeline dependency management (DAG support)
- Web UI for pipeline management (because CLIs are cool, but GUIs are cooler)
